# Playing-with-PINNs
I try to get myself familiar with Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN), by trying an easy example.

I have started by exporing how you could approach the problem without knowing about PINNs, as is illustrated in the "Approximating 1D Diffusion with a neural network.ipynb" notebook.

In the "PINN applied to 1D Diffusion.ipynb" notebook you can see a PINN applied to the same problem.
